Plan:
1. Intro class (3.11): how to visualize and work with model data
2. Follow-up for the 3.11 excercise: 8.12, we are going to start the follow-up excercise with real simulations.
2. Prepare a real model simulation (TBD): register at https://www.hpc.uni-bonn.de/en/hpc-infrastructure/registration-for-access-to-the-bonna-cluster
3. Run and analyse a model simulation (TBD)
